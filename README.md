Visual studio code is certainly possible but troublesome. neither clangd nor intellisense seem to do a good enough job of handling mbed.

Never use keil studio. Only use mbed studio. Keil Studio will make debugging annoying. Install mbed studio with the st-link drivers and just use standard debug tools
